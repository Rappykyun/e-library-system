## File Structure Guidelines

### Backend (Laravel)

- Controllers should be organized by feature area (`Admin/`, `Student/`, `Auth/`)
- Use Resource Controllers for CRUD operations
- Implement proper middleware for role-based access
- Models should include relationships and scopes
- Use Form Requests for validation

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- Components organized by feature (`components/admin/`, `components/student/`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use shadcn/ui components consistently
- Follow React hooks best practices

## Coding Standards

### Laravel Backend

```php
// Use strict typing
declare(strict_types=1);

// Use Resource Controllers
class BookController extends Controller
{
    public function index(): JsonResponse
    public function store(StoreBookRequest $request): JsonResponse
    public function show(Book $book): JsonResponse
    public function update(UpdateBookRequest $request, Book $book): JsonResponse
    public function destroy(Book $book): JsonResponse
}

// Use proper middleware
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::resource('books', BookController::class);
});
```

### React Frontend

```typescript
// Use TypeScript interfaces
interface Book {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  author: string;
  category: Category;
  pdf_url: string;
  download_count: number;
}

// Use proper component structure
export function BookCard({ book, onDownload }: BookCardProps) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Card className="hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      {/* Component content */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```
